What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	The files are added to the repository and it prepares to track the changes to all the files when a commit is done.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is the temporary holding area between the working directory and the repository. The staging area allows you go group files together before you do a commit.
