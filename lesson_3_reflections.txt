When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you want to share your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You may not want to commit all the changes you have made remotely.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork clones data with a reference back to the original creator.
	Clone copies the data in the same repository - no link exists to the original.
	Branch is adding something new to the existing repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	You can add your changes without being connected to the internet.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	You would have to manually keep track of any changes. It would be almost impossible for two people to work on the same file withoug git and gitHub.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	When I'm making a fairly substantial change - so it can be tested before being merged into master. This will ensure that master is always working properly.
