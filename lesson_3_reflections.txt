When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you want to share your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You may not want to commit all the changes you have made remotely.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork clones data with a reference back to the original creator.
	Clone copies the data in the same repository - no link exists to the original.
	Branch is adding something new to the existing repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	You can add your changes without being connected to the internet.
